1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,711
let us calculate the moment of inertia of
a disc. about an axis of rotation, which is

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:11,111
passing through the centre of disc. and it
is perpendicular to the plane of disc. as,

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:16,190
disk is a rigid body we can not directly calculate
its moment of inertia we first need to consider

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:23,710
an, element. and, by integration of moment
of inertia of elements of ring , over the

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,941
given range, will find the moment of inertia
of disc. here, for a disc we can consider

6
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:40,561
a small elemental rings, which are of radius
x, and width d x. like this. so if we consider

7
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:47,381
such elemental rings, which are of radius
x and having width d x, several such rings

8
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:54,991
when integrated from centre to. this circumference
of disc. we can say will be get the whole

9
00:00:54,991 --> 00:01:04,041
disc. for this element, if says mass is d
m. we can write the mass of, element as. mass

10
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:14,321
of. elemental ring. is . this can be written
as mass per unit area multiplied by the area

11
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:21,241
occupied by this ring. so the total mass of
disc is m and its radius is r. here we can

12
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:31,010
say its mass per unit area is m by pie r square.
multiplied with the area occupied by the disc

13
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,201
. which can be given as, its length, into
the. width, that can be written as two pie

14
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:45,471
x, d x. as we can see we cut the ring and
flatten it. its , length will be two pie x

15
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:51,741
and width can be taken as d x. so in this
situation the mass of this element will write

16
00:01:51,741 --> 00:02:00,101
as m by r square into two x d x. now if it
is a ring, as we can see this is a ring , the

17
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:10,941
moment of inertia . of the elemental ring.
can be given as. d i, which can be written

18
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:17,721
as d m x square. so in this situation as we
have, just now studied moment of inertia for

19
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:23,291
ring we can write as m r square , so for a
ring having mass d m and radius x moment of

20
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:29,251
inertia can be written as, d m x square. this
we can write as , just we substitute the value

21
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:38,871
of d m over here. will be two m by r square,
multiplied by x cube d x. now total moment

22
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:47,311
of inertia . of whole disc. can be given by
integration of all such elements , which is

23
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:54,811
integration of d i m we can write it integration
of two m by r square into x cube d x. and

24
00:02:54,811 --> 00:03:01,630
we substitute the limits of integration from
zero to , r. now here, mass and radius of

25
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,991
the disc can be taken as constant , here only
variable is x. so integration of x cube can

26
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:15,941
be, taken as directly x four by four, and
we put the limits from zero to r. here we

27
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:25,061
can see will get it, two m by r square into,
r four by four minus zero. so here this two

28
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,850
gets cancelled out and r square gets cancelled
out , will get the moment of inertia of disc

29
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:39,191
to be. half m r square. this is the standard
result for moment of inertia for disc, about

30
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:43,731
an axis of rotation which is passing through
its centre and perpendicular to the, plane

31
00:03:43,731 --> 00:00:00,000
of disc
